# St. John's Episcopal Church Vitual Tour
A virtual tour developed for the [Oakdale Historical Society](https://oakdale-historical-society.weeblysite.com/) using [Marzipano](https://www.marzipano.net/).

## Context
This [web application](https://vive_.gitlab.io/st-johns-tour/) was built for my Benevolent Computing (ISE 339) course at Stony Brook University. ISE 339 was a project class that focused on building code for non-profit and charity organizations. 

## Code
I utilized the Marzipano project's ability to make a 3D environment from panoramic images as a base, and added/removed elements to better suit the Oakdale Historical Societies needs. The virtual tour largely focuses on providing images, audio, and historical facts related to families found in the Church's graveyard.
